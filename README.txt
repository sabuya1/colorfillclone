about

The game called Flood-It has been around for some years. There are many
clones and variants available for desktop and mobile platforms.

The game board is a grid of squares, colored at random in multiple colors.
In each move the player changes the color of the "start square" and all squares
of the same color that are connected to it. The objective is to fill the entire
grid in a single color using as few moves as possible.

This program, ColorFill, is yet another clone of this game. It includes an
interactive GUI mode which lets you play the puzzles and explore the solutions
that its integrated solver algorithms have found.

The program also has a dedicated "solver mode" that uses the algorithms to
solve two competition tasks that I've found on the internet:
- "Programming Challenge 19" (1000 14x14 boards; see directory pc19)
- "Code Golf 26232" (100000 19x19 boards; see directory codegolf26232)
