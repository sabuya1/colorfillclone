(question/contest originally published on 2014-04-23 and closed by accepting
the answer/winning program by tigrou on 2014-05-10)

Your task is to create a program that will take a 19-by-19 grid of colours from
1 to 6 as input, in whatever form you choose [...] and return a sequence of
colours that the center square will change to each turn, again in the format
of your choosing [...]
At the end of each sequence of moves, the squares in the 19-by-19 grid must all
be the same colour.

Your program must be entirely deterministic; pseudorandom solutions are
allowed, but the program must generate the same output for the same test case
every time.

The winning program will take the fewest total number of steps to solve all
100,000 test cases found in this file (zipped text file, 14.23 MB).
If two solutions take the same number of steps (e.g. if they both found the
optimal strategy), the shorter program will win.

the files:

floodtest           = input file, contains the 100,000 test cases
01_tigrou.cs        = winning program by tigrou
steps_01_tigrou.txt = output of winning program by tigrou: 2,098,382 steps

01_user1502040.c    = new, even better program by user1502040
steps_01_user1502040.txt = output of program by user1502040: 2,075,590 steps
(note: the original program crashed and had to be fixed; this change seems to
produce a slightly different/worse result, 138 steps more than claimed)


output of this program, ColorFill: 2,116,152 steps (would have been 2nd place)

steps_ColorFill_DFS.txt         = output of ColorFill using its 4 DFS strategies
steps_ColorFill_DFS_details.txt = detailed output (5887 CPU minutes!)


added 2015-10-20:
output of this program, ColorFill: 2,095,015 steps (would have been 1st place!)

steps_ColorFill_AStar_DFS.txt         = A* (tigrou) + 2 fast DFS strategies
steps_ColorFill_AStar_DFS_details.txt = detailed output (193 CPU minutes)

added 2017-12-06:
output of this program, ColorFill: attempt to solve it using exhaustive search!

steps.txt  = A* (tigrou) + 2 fast DFS strategies + exhaustive DFS
steps_.txt = detailed output (shows failed attempts / OutOfMemoryError)

this is work in progress, but very likely it will never be finished because the
exhaustive search needs too much time. also, it fails with OutOfMemoryError and
doesn't give the optimal solution for about 1/5 of the test cases on my machine
that has 16GB of RAM. (using "java -Xmx14800M")

extrapolating the current, partial result, we can expect that the total number
of steps found by exhaustive search would be less than 2,000,000.

updated 2018-02-10:
output of this program, ColorFill: attempt to solve it using AStar search!

steps.txt  = A* (Puchert heuristic) optimal solutions
steps_.txt = detailed output

This is work in progress!
current partial result: first 43890 test cases solved in 871136 steps
extrapolated total result: 1984816 steps

The new AStarPuchertStrategy finds optimal solutions and is very fast. Thanks
to Aaron and Simon Puchert for their solver program which served as a template!
